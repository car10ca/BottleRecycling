# Recycling Bottle Exchange Platform

## Project Overview
This website was developed as a teamwork project during my **BA in Computer Science**. The primary goal was to apply **Agile development methodologies** while creating a functional and user-friendly platform for bottle recycling. The project received a **grade of 82%**, which is considered an **A by UK university standards**.

## How It Works
The platform connects individuals who have recycling bottles to give away with those willing to pick them up. Users can:
- **Offer bottles** for pickup.
- **Book pickups** and return bottles to reverse vending machines.
- **Keep the deposit money** as an incentive.

## Technologies Used
The website was built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript   
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express  
- **Database:** **MySQL on Amazon RDS (AWS Free Student Tier)**  
  - The project used **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)** with **MySQL** to manage user and transaction data.  
  - The cloud-based database ensured scalability and availability.  

## My Role
As part of a four-person team, my primary responsibility was **frontend development**, including:
- **Website design** and styling using **HTML & CSS**  
- **Ensuring responsive design** for different devices  
- **Collaborating with backend developers** to integrate UI elements  

This project was a great learning experience in **Agile teamwork, frontend development, and cloud-based database integration**. ðŸš€
